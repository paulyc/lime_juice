# lime_juice
Take samples from a LimeSDR and dump them straight to the standard output! Cause I've spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get gnuradio to do that one simple thing but the entire gnuradio ecosystem has turned into a nightmarish chimera of Python 2 and 3 and none of it works together. Why, Guido, why? We needed Python 3 about as much as we still need Perl 6.
