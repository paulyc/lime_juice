# lime_juice
Take samples from a LimeSDR and dump them straight to the standard output! Cause I've spent an inordinate amount of time trying to get gnuradio to do that one simple thing but the entire gnuradio ecosystem has turned into a nightmarish chimera of Python 2 and 3 and none of it works together. Why, Guido, why? We needed Python 3 about as much as we still need Perl 6.

C++ may have such a massive language spec that no one man or woman can possibly know all of it, and Java may have such a small language spec that anything written in it turns out incredibly verbose, but at least original ANSI C++ is still valid C++17 and valid Java 1 is still valid Java 9. Someone needs to go back in time and stop Guido from creating Python 3, like Miles Dyson and Cyberdyne in Terminator 2. I still can't even tell Python 2 from Python 3; I just have to run everything in both and see which crashes less.
